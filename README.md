#PHP Facts Alexa Skill

This is the code behind the PHP Facts Alexa Skill (currently awaiting certification).

The skill has been created as a simple example of using the [Alexa Skills Kit For PHP](https://github.com/AlexaBible/Alexa-Skills-Kit-SDK-For-PHP).
It shows how easy it is to create a skill using the SDK (although this is a simple facts skill).
